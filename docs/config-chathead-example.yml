# ============================================
# ChatHead Configuration Example
# ============================================
# Add this to your config.yml file

chathead:
  # Enable or disable the ChatHead system
  # Set to false to completely disable player head rendering in chat
  # Default: true
  enabled: true

  # Skin source for fetching player skins
  #
  # Available options:
  #   AUTO     - Automatically selects the best source based on server mode [RECOMMENDED]
  #              Online mode  -> Uses MOJANG (official, most reliable)
  #              Offline mode -> Uses MINOTAR (supports name-based retrieval)
  #
  #   MOJANG   - Official Mojang API
  #              ✅ Best for online mode servers
  #              ❌ Does NOT work in offline mode (requires valid Mojang UUIDs)
  #
  #   MINOTAR  - Minotar service
  #              ✅ Works in both online and offline mode
  #              ✅ Supports name-based retrieval (perfect for cracked servers)
  #              ⚡ Generally faster than Mojang
  #
  #   CRAFATAR - Crafatar service
  #              ✅ Fast and reliable for online mode
  #              ❌ Does NOT work in offline mode (UUID-based only)
  #
  #   MCHEADS  - MC-Heads service (currently uses Minotar implementation)
  #              ✅ Works in both online and offline mode
  #
  # Default: AUTO
  skin-source: AUTO

  # How long to cache player heads (in minutes)
  #
  # Performance considerations:
  #   - Longer cache = Better performance, less API calls, but skins update slower
  #   - Shorter cache = More API calls, slightly worse performance, but fresher skins
  #
  # Recommended values:
  #   Small servers (< 50 players):  2-5 minutes
  #   Medium servers (50-200):       5-10 minutes
  #   Large servers (200+):          10-15 minutes
  #
  # Default: 5
  cache-time-minutes: 5

  # Whether to include the second skin layer (helmet/overlay) by default
  #
  # true  = Show full head with hat/accessories (looks better, slightly slower)
  # false = Show only base skin layer (faster, but no accessories)
  #
  # Note: You can still override this per-call in code using API methods
  #
  # Default: true
  use-overlay-by-default: true


# ============================================
# Example Configurations for Different Setups
# ============================================

# --- For Cracked/Offline Servers ---
# If your server.properties has: online-mode=false
#
# chathead:
#   enabled: true
#   skin-source: AUTO         # Will automatically use Minotar
#   cache-time-minutes: 10    # Longer cache (offline skins change less)
#   use-overlay-by-default: true

# --- For Premium/Online Servers ---
# If your server.properties has: online-mode=true
#
# chathead:
#   enabled: true
#   skin-source: AUTO         # Will automatically use Mojang
#   cache-time-minutes: 5     # Standard cache
#   use-overlay-by-default: true

# --- For High-Performance Servers ---
# Optimized for maximum performance
#
# chathead:
#   enabled: true
#   skin-source: MINOTAR      # Minotar is generally faster
#   cache-time-minutes: 15    # Maximum recommended cache
#   use-overlay-by-default: false  # Slightly faster without overlay

# --- For Testing/Development ---
# Quick skin updates for testing
#
# chathead:
#   enabled: true
#   skin-source: MINOTAR      # Fast and reliable
#   cache-time-minutes: 1     # Quick updates
#   use-overlay-by-default: true

# --- To Disable ChatHead ---
# If you don't want player heads in chat
#
# chathead:
#   enabled: false
#   # Other options are ignored when disabled


# ============================================
# Troubleshooting
# ============================================

# Problem: Heads not showing at all
# Solution: Check that enabled: true and your skin-source is compatible
#           with your server mode (online/offline)

# Problem: Wrong skins showing
# Solution: Reduce cache-time-minutes or reload: /supremechat reload

# Problem: Performance issues
# Solution: Increase cache-time-minutes to reduce API calls

# Problem: Offline mode heads not working
# Solution: Use skin-source: AUTO or MINOTAR (not MOJANG or CRAFATAR)
